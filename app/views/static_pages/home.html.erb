<h1>StaticPages#home</h1>
<p>
	This is the home page for the
	<a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
sample application.
<br>
With all the preparation from Section 3.1 finished, we’re ready to get started developing the sample application. In this section, we’ll take a first step toward making dynamic pages by creating a set of Rails actions and views containing only static HTML. 5 
<br>
Rails actions come bundled together inside controllers (the C in MVC from Section 1.3.3), which contain sets of actions related by a
common purpose. We got a glimpse of controllers in Chapter 2, and will come to a deeper understanding once we explore the REST architecture more fully(starting in Chapter 6). 
<br>
In order to get our bearings, it’s helpful to recall the
Rails directory structure from Section 1.3 (Figure 1.4). In this section, we’ll be working mainly in the app/controllers and app/views directories.
